Mysterium is still ongoing, but we thought we'd post a brief outline of
what we announced during our presentation just a few minutes ago.

First, we showed the gameplay as it stands now. You can watch a
condensed walkthrough of that, including our brand-new sky,Â \ `here`_
(it had to be re-run since the video didn't go through the first time),
or by watching the video below.

You can also watch (or rather, listen to) the `first attempt at showing
the game`_ (actual presentation starts at 4:07), which didn't go so well
because of streaming issues.

Then, we announced the exciting news that Cyan Worlds, Inc. has agreed
to allow us to proceed with our project! We also showed a short video of
Boiler Island as it stands now (shown in the video linked to above), and
we have just recently added a new post to our `dev blog`_ for your
enjoyment.
