As of this morning, we've achieved our primary funding goal of $2000!
Thank you so much to everybody who's donated so far, you've really made
this project a viable possibility. If you haven't yet donated, please
don't let this deter you, we could always make use of extra funds. The
more we have, the faster we can work, in theory. We'll keep updating the
progress bar on the right, until it hits the edge of the page.

In the meantime, we're working on pulling together a treat for you guys
to show our appreciation. We went from 90% to 100% a little faster than
we expected, so we don't have anything quite ready yet. We've got
something coming, though!

Thanks again, everybody.

Edit: There have been a couple of recent instances of people, for
whatever reason, accidentally donating twice. If this happens to you,
we'll fully refund the second donation as soon as we notice it. If we
don't contact you, please don't hesitate to contact us and point it out.
