We don't usually do this sort of thing, but we got such a big traffic
boost from `Reddit`_ the other day, we just had to share. We've never
seen such a drastic spike - those horizontal bars are counting thousands
of unique hits, and all of the non-Reddit days still average in the
hundreds - still nothing to scoff at.

We got about $55 in donations, over 100 beta signups, and some other
interesting side effects. More news soon!
