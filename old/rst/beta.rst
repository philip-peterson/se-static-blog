Some good news from the Starry Expanse Project team:

We have decided that before the year is out, it will be necessary for us
to have formed a beta testing team. "But Cho," you may ask, "who will
form this elite team of testers?" "Why," I would answer, "you! You, my
dear friend, could be invited to participate in the testing of the
Starry Expanse Project!" (screenshots of which are readily available in
other posts on this very blog).
 All that will be required to use the Beta is a working installation of
URU: Complete Chronicles and the latest version of OfflineKI (or your
favorite flavor of age management tools). Although we will start with a
small pool of testers at first, we do intend to increase the size of the
beta-testing team, so even if you are not accepted at first, you may
still be given the opportunity to test.

That's all we can tell you for now, but check back soon for a signup!
