Wow! Since our `last post`_, we've received enough donations to pass our
halfway point towards being able to buy our Unity Pro license. You guys
rock! Help us keep the dream going, and give that Donate button over on
the sidebar a tap! Remember, a donation of any amount gets your name in
the credits of our game, but the more you give, the higher your name
will be!
