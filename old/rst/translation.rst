The Starry Expanse Project not only aims to rebuild Riven but to open
the reconstructions to the public. The public consists of many people
speaking many languages, so the Starry Expanse Project will be making
use of the **`URU Localization Project`_**'s user-contributed
translations of Riven.

What does that mean? It means YOU can help translate Riven so that
others can follow along when playing. :-) To get started, just `go to
the ULP's website (http://rel.to/ulp)`_ and click "Get an Account".
Thanks for helping out! Here's a bonus screenshot for your trouble.
