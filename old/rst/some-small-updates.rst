Hey there - Just wanted to let you guys know that work is continuing,
despite our silence. I've posted a couple of things to our `forum`_ in
the last week, and I figured I'd repost them here. They depict (very
preliminary) work on the new sky system, and some rigging work on
Catherine:

We're not dead! We haven't given up! Thanks for continuing to believe in
us!

That being said, we could really use another experienced programmer or
two. We'd like help developing both the engine, and some backend tools
for us to manage the project. If you're interested in helping out (in
this or any other way), just `send us an e-mail`_, and we'll let you
know if we can use you.
