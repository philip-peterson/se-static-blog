The Starry Expanse Project (also known as simply *Starry Expanse* or
sometimes *realRiven*) is an official fan project to remake the game
*Riven: The Sequel to Myst* in real time 3D. For those who don’t know,
the original game was essentially an interactive slideshow of
2-dimensional pictures that changed based on where a person clicked
their mouse. This remake features rich, full 3D movement like one finds
in most modern first-person adventure games.

We accomplish this goal by carefully examining the original shots from
*Riven* and constructing 3D representations based on those 2D images,
which is quite challenging. The Starry Expanse Project is a long-term
one; the original game took dozens of artists several years to complete.
We are a much more humble, volunteer-based outfit, so it will most
certainly take us longer, but with our extreme dedication, we are
certain that we will finish, ensuring that every detail is accurate,
realistic, and as true to the original game as possible.

We released a `public demo`_ of the game in late 2012.

For more information, you can watch the presentations we gave at
Mysterium in `2010`_, `2011`_, and `2012`_. You can also follow us on
several `social media outlets`_, though the best source for news is this
website.

\ **Frequently Asked Questions\ ** ****\ 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Will you support the Oculus Rift device?**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Short answer: not at this time, no. Long answer: see `this
post`_.\ **** ****

**Who are you?**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We’re just huge Myst fans with spare time, talent, and a lot of passion.
Check out our `Team Roster`_.

**Does Cyan Worlds know about you?**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Yes! That's the coolest part of the whole thing; Cyan Worlds seems to
really like us. They've offered to help us out, even going so far as to
provide resources and assets from the original game! We're living out
our fan dreams.

**That’s really cool! Can I see the stuff Cyan is sharing with you?**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unfortunately we can’t disclose either the assets or information about
the assets due to contractual obligations.

**When is it going to be done? When will the beta be ready?**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It will take a long time; it will take years. We are committed to making
the game as high of a quality as necessary to do the original justice,
and as such the project will take as long as it needs to. At the same
time, we are also very busy students and some of us have jobs, so our
time commitment is limited. Thus, development is not spread evenly
throughout the year, and each year we become more efficient and
organized, so it’s very difficult to come up with a timescale for the
project. This is why we’ve simply decided to stick with the answer: it
will be done when it’s done.

Will you support Linux / XBOX / iPhone / Android / WiiU / PS3 / Toaster?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Right now, the answer is no. We are set to support Windows and Mac
personal computer operating systems only. In the future, we may choose
to add mobile support, but don’t count on it.

**Have you considered a Kickstarter?**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have considered it, and while it's definitely a possibility for the
future, we're not planning one right now.

**How much will the game cost? Will it be open-source?**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have no idea; it’s something we have yet to work out with Cyan. We
don’t know how much it will cost or how it will be distributed, but it
likely will not be free. As a result, it’s unlikely that the whole
product would be made open-source, but it’s possible that individual
components of the game will be made open-source.

I would like to join this project. How can I help?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Awesome. We could use some help. Send us an email at
`general@starryexpanse.com`_; we’re much more interested if you provide
us a résumé and/or examples of past work. There’s also `a list of
talent`_ we are in need of.

I sent you guys an email, but you never responded! Did I say something wrong?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Nope. Again, we're a very small team of volunteers, with not a whole lot
of time to spend managing the project. This means that unfortunately, a
lot of emails we receive get put onto the "reply to this someday" stack.

Actually, chances are, if you don't get a reply from us, it's because
you said something really interesting, which merits a much more
thought-out response than we're able to give quickly. We do make an
effort to reply to every email we get, but we're still not very good at
it. Sorry!

I donated some money, but the funding counter didn't change! Are you guys stealing our donations, or what?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Our funding counter is currently updated by hand - we promise that all
donations received are eventually tallied up and added to the funding
counter, it just doesn't happen immediately. This goes back to the whole
we-don't-have-much-time issue.

I donated $20, but the funding counter went up by $19.31! You guys are stealing my money, aren't you?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once again, no, kindest paranoid fan, we are not stealing your money --
what's happening is, PayPal takes a cut of every donation we receive,
and we only count money that we can actually use. This deduction is
important to remember for another reason, which is that if you donate
less than $1, we don't actually get any of it.

What are you using all that money for, anyway?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Money donated is generally used for licensing technologies for use in
the game. We licensed Unity Pro using donated funds, our original sky
system was purchased using donated funds, etc. Additionally, the
maintenance of our servers incurs yearly costs. While we do not disclose
all of our spending, we do promise that all donated money will be used
for purchases which directly benefit the production of the game itself.
