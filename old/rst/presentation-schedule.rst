The `Mysterium Boston site`_ has posted the `tentative schedule`_ for
this year's Mysterium. If you check it out, you can see that we'll be
presenting bright and early on Friday, starting around 10 AM. There will
be a Q&A session after the presentation, and we'll try to address any
questions that are sent in before then during this time. Feel free to
use the comments section here to ask questions before the presentation,
or else post them to CyanChat or the Ustream chat during the
presentation, and hope that somebody there is nice enough to ask for
you.
