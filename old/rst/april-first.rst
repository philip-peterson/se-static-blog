Historically, our stance on platform support for the Starry Expanse
Project has always been that Mac OS and Windows come first, and
everything else is a possibility for the future. But as technology
advances, so must our project. Today, we're excited to announce that
we'll be bringing The Starry Expanse Project to a new platform - a
mobile one.

We recognize that mobile platforms, particularly phones, are the way of
the future. More and more games are being released for the iPhone,
Android, and sometimes even Windows Phone platforms. These devices all
have their pros and cons, but we have found that none of them really
have the staying power, the resilience that we require of our
technology.

There is, however, one platform that does meet these criteria. A
powerful, flexible, mobile platform, with the strength to resist any and
all competition.

We are, of course, talking about the Nokia 5110.

That's right, folks. As of today, we are officially adding the Nokia
5110 to our lineup of supported systems. The game will be made available
for the mobile platform on the *same* *day* as it's available for Mac OS
and Windows, and it will be a *fully* functional version of the game -
not the usual crippled fare you'll find in a mobile edition. We aren't
cutting any corners; check out some of these screencaps below, taken
from our dev unit:

beautiful 1-bit color.[/caption]

extreme attention to detail, including a dynamic cloud system and moving
water![/caption]

Puzzles|`_ Every puzzle works exactly as it does on Mac and
Windows.[/caption]

well.|`_ And of course, the awesome maglev rides have been faithfully

Keep in mind that, as with all screenshots that we post, these are \ **a
work in progress**. We *are* aware there are some problems and glitches,
so please refrain from reporting them.

We're feeling extra generous today, so we decided to give you guys a
sneak peek at another aspect of the project, one that we are asked about
quite a lot: \ **sound!** For a long time now, we've been debating how
we're going to be handling the music in our game, whether or not to
remake (or even replace) the score originally composed and performed by
Robyn Miller. Well, we've finally reached a decision, and well...we hope
you agree that we made the right one. Have a listen to a sample of the
soundtrack from the upcoming Nokia 5110 edition of the Starry Expanse
Project:

We are really excited about the new platform, let us know what you guys
think of it! What other platforms would you like to see the game ported
to?

**Update:** **Unfortunately, \ `development issues`_ have forced us to
rescind our support for the Nokia 5110.**
