Well, we kind of hoped that allowing beta signups to go through only for
a limited time would raise hype and that people would sign up for beta
like, as soon as they could.

Turns out that wasn't the case. Despite our weirdly gigantic spikes in
unique visitor counts each time we posted something containing the word
"beta," we only got around ten beta testing applications.

So! We've decided to re-open the beta test signup process until we get
more beta signups than we know what to do with (note: this **doesn't**
mean we won't be checking for quality in your application). At our
previous rate of beta signup, that would've happened around year 2121,
so let's hope we get some more signups quicker this time. ;-) Beta is
officially open again!

`Here`_ is the signup page. If you find out who we are (not that hard)
please don't tell anyone. Thanks!
