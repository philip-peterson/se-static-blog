Still no awesome reward for reaching the funding goal, although this is
pretty cool, too.

We've noticed an increase lately in discussion in the comments section
on our posts, so we decided to look into alternative methods of
discussion. We had a forum set up, but it was causing us all sorts of
headaches. Instead, we found a service we like a lot, called `Convore`_.
It's kind of like a hybrid between a forum and a chatroom, in that it's
live-updating, but it's topic-based, like a forum. It's very cool.

So `come talk to us!`_ You know you want to.
