Not that you all would give up hope, being URU fans, but the project
(we'd like to assert) is not dead. We are simply taken yet another one
of our long and unannounced hiatuses\* while we deal with school-related
issues and ponder the meaning of our lives. Soon we'll come to the
ultimate realization (as we always do) that the way we can maximize the
significances of our existences is by working on the Starry Expanse
Project, and when that happens, the project will resume.
 \* Not hiati; we looked it up.

Also, we're currently in great need for a character artist, a person
with a lot of 3D Studio Max experience and a skill for passing on
knowledge, and a texture artist with a particular skill for mapping the
danged pictures.

So that's it from the Starry Expanse... sorry to not bring any earth- or
Riven-shattering news, but since you all deserve it for your enduring
patience, here's a pastry of sorts: <insert pie here>.
