That's right!  Beta signups are coming soon.

We're still working on some server-side things, but in a few days
(really, this time) we will post a downloadable that will let you sign
up for beta testing.  Keep in mind you must be willing to submit bug
reports and feedback on a regular basis, not just willing to get a sneak
peek!

The lists will \*probably\* fill up fairly quickly, and we're running
this thing on a first-come-first-serve basis. (hint, hint.)  So you may
want to camp out around here when it comes close to Beta-signer-upper
release time.

We will make another post announcing the exact time of release at least
twenty-four (24) hours in advance.
