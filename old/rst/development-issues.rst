Unfortunately, it looks like yesterday's `announcement`_Â of support for
the Nokia 5110 was a bit premature. It turns out, we don't actually have
any way of distributing the game to the 5110, due to limitations in the
hardware.

As much as it saddens us to say it, we're going to have to rescind our
support for the platform. Perhaps one day, technology will be
sufficiently advanced for us to renew our support of the Nokia 5110, but
for now, you're going to have to play the game on Mac OS X or Windows.
