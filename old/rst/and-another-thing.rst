We're feeling generous, so here's a re-shoot of the Prison Island
walkthrough that was posted before. We tried to capture video from a
newer build, but none of the results worked properly, so this video is
from the same build as the last video was, so it lacks the newer
features that we've completed since Mysterium. Still, it's a much
smoother demonstration of what was done at that point - and it has
sound, which I think really adds to the experience.

As with before, this is very much a work in progress, particularly the
sky, water, and firemarble dome.

Enjoy!
