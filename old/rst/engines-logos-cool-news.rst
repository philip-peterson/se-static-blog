It's been a while since we've written a post updating everyone with the
goings-on in the Starry Expanse Project. Too long, says I. Read on, and
discover what's been going on behind the closed doors of the Starry
Expanse Project.

 
 **59 Volt Entertainment**

First of all, our group now has a real name! No longer are we simply
"the Starry Expanse Project team". Henceforth, we will be known as "59
Volt Entertainment", or just "59 Volts". If you've played Myst and have
a mind for remembering details, you'll probably know the significance of
the name. Otherwise, go replay Myst! The project itself is still known
as The Starry Expanse Project.

 

**Logo**

To go with our snazzy new name, we've whipped ourselves up a snazzy new
logo. You may have seen it already, in the corner of our `April Fool's
Images`_. Well, here it is in its full glory.

**New Members**

We've assimilated (as the Borg do) some great talent recently; check out
the `Team Roster`_ for bios of all of our members, past and present.

 

**Donations**

We are once again accepting donations to help fund The Starry Expanse
Project. If you're interested in helping us on the road to completing an
awesome game, please click the 'Donate' button below or on the sidebar
of this page. Oh, by the way, **anybody who donates will have their name
put in the credits!** For more details, check out the sidebar to the
right, or shoot us an e-mail.

**New Engine**

"But Cho!" you may exclaim. "Why does 59 Volts need money? I thought
Blender Game Engine was free... surely they aren't going to be pocketing
my money!" Rest assured — no, we aren't taking your money for ourselves.
While the Blender Game Engine is free, we are, in fact, no longer using
Blender Game Engine to develop The Starry Expanse. Nay, we have moved on
to bigger and better engines— namely, **`Unity`_!**

Unity is awesome. It's fast, powerful, and compatible with Windows, Mac
OS X, iOS, Android, PS3, Wii, and Xbox 360! It's really spectacular. If
you want an idea of how much better it is than the BGE, remember that at
`Mysterium last year`_, the demo Zib showed stuttered along at 10 frames
per second (and we were lucky). In Unity, we have yet to see anything
shy of 50fps for similarly detailed scenes... yeah.

There are only two big downsides to Unity.

#. **No Linux/OpenBSD/Solaris/HURD/etc. support.** We're looking into
   work-arounds for this, such as Cider-style wrappers, or simple WINE
   compatibility, similar to how MOUL became Mac-compatible. If you're
   interested in helping us research these possibilities, please contact
   us.
#. **It ain't free.** Unity costs $1500 for a Pro license. We've been
   developing under an Indie license for a few months now, but we're
   going to need the Pro license in order to make the best game
   possible. Trust us, it's going to be amazing with those Pro features.

Apart from these two, Unity has bested BGE in every way that we have
thought to compare the two. It has full compatibility with .blend files
as well as a few other modeling programs, so we can all work in the
environments we're most accustomed to. This also means that very little
work was needed to convert the existing resources into Unity-compatible
ones. That said, we are currently re-working many of the existing assets
to make them higher quality, more accurate, and more efficient.

 

**The Future**

So that's where we are now. We've got a real name, a logo, new members,
and a new engine. Our game is starting to take shape, albeit much more
slowly than we would like. We still are not ready to start beta-testing,
but rest assured that we are preparing for the day when we will be. If
you have expressed an interest to us in beta testing, we still have your
name — don't worry.

Zib (and possibly other members of 59 Volt Entertainment) will be at
`Mysterium`_ again this year. (He ought to be, as he's helping to plan
it.) If you want to find out more about The Starry Expanse Project,
Mysterium 2011 is the place to be. Join us in early August, somewhere in
the Boston area, for a weekend of awesome Myst-related activities. Keep
an eye on the `Mysterium Boston 2011 site`_ for further details.
