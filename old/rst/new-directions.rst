**Edit: Yes, this was an April Fool's joke. Starry Expanse is still in
production, and the two games described below are not.**\ That being
said, if you want to work on Riven: The Board Game, send Zib and e-mail
at zib@starryexpanse.com :D

We've been spending a lot of time discussing our little project, and
we've come to the conclusion that re-making Riven in 3D just isn't what
we want to be spending our time on. There doesn't seem to be enough
support from the Myst community in general for the project to be worth
it. So we're officially canceling The Starry Expanse Project.

That being said, we'd like to announce two projects that are, at this
point, well under-way and nearing the beta testing stage! We hope you'll
have as much fun playing them as we've had putting them together.

The first is a game born from a brainstorming session about how to
broaden the appeal of Riven, and make it more palatable to the general
public. 59 Volt Entertainment presents the first-ever screenshot
from \ **Riven: Stranger's Wrath**:

You can play as the Moiety, or as Gehn's supporters (pictured). There
will be the usual assortment of guns, knives, and grenades, as well as
traditional Rivenese weapons, and Gehn's poison dart rifle. We plan on
having some really great competitive online gameplay, via Xbox Live. The
great part about this game is that we can actually continue to use the
assets we've already produced, and just port them all over to Source!

The other project is a bit riskier, but we think that it will be a big
hit as well. Say hello to \ **Riven: The Board Game**:

Also check out the `really big version`_.

After spending the past few months designing the boards, writing up the
rules (we managed to trim it down to about 550 pages), and extensive
playtesting, I can tell you that this is a seriously fun game. If you
liked the Myst board game, you're going to love this one. The average
game lasts between six to twenty hours, and is playable by up to 25
people! The final game is going to be printed on this really
high-quality glossy cardboard, but for beta testing we'll just put up
pdfs for you to print out.

Check back here over the next few weeks for more updates on these two!
