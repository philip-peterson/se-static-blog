The Starry Expanse team has an odd request. We are looking for someone
who looks extremely similar to this guy.

The reason we're asking for this is that we don't have good enough
reference material to reliably recreate the character ("Cho"), so we're
searching for a lookalike. Many hours at Google Image Search have
yielded nothing, and so we turn to our readers. Have you seen this man?
If so, shoot us an email at `cho102997@gmail.com`_.
