Our `AMA on Reddit`_ went over spectacularly! Not only did we get over
**4000 upvotes** and make the default **front page** (a feat in and of
itself), but we also drew in over **13,000 unique visitors** to this
site, and received nearly **$200 in donations**. Best of all, we got
more than **20 new volunteers**! Don't worry if you haven't heard back
from us yet, we're just a bit snowed under with these emails. If you
sent us an e-mail, we're working on it, and we should get a reply back
to you shortly.

**Thank you so much** to everybody who participated! And if you didn't
get a chance to ask your question, just leave it as a comment here, on
an older post, or `send us an email`_!
