Yesterday (December 22nd, because yes, it is \ *totally* `still December
23rd`_) was The Starry Expanse's fourth birthday! The project began
around 6pm that night in 2008, with a rather optimistic conversation
about the future of the official Plasma tools Cyan had recently promised
to deliver. Our original plan, for the uninitiated, was to rebuild all
of Riven within `Uru`_, using `Cyan's official tools`_. We knew nothing
about the tools (which were not actually released for another year), we
did not own 3DS Max, and we had extremely limited knowledge of how
Plasma worked.

What we did have was the combined power of two crazy fans, and a dream.
An insane, ridiculously over-ambitious dream.

Well, four years later, we're proud (kind of way too proud, probably) to
**finally** be able to let you guys actually play something that we've
made as a result of that conversation. It's been a crazy ride so far,
with multiple engine upgrades, an ever-expanding team of Very Talented
People™, nearly $4000 in donations, and hey - official approval from
Cyan Worlds. Not too shabby.

We're sorry that we've been so quiet recently. We're mostly all college
students, and the fall semester is always a crazy time for us. Now that
*that's* over, however, we're back to work, and things are moving
forward. You can probably expect to hear more from us in the next few
weeks.

SO: What do we have ready for you guys to play with today? Well, it's
pretty much what we showed off `at Mysterium`_. It's more polished,
better-suited for public consumption, but everything you saw at
Mysterium is there: you can explore Prison Island, open the firemarble
dome, ride the elevator, birdwatch, even mess around with the
environment. It's all very pretty, and just a taste of everything that's
to come. Be sure to check the included readme file for an explanation of
how to change the environment settings.

To be clear:\ **we're calling this a \ *demo*, not a \ *beta*.** We're
showing off some of what we have done, sharing our baby with the public
for the first time. We're not specifically looking to find problems with
it, we're well aware of what's still broken or missing. So you can
relax, and simply enjoy the first public hands-on experience of our
game. That said, if you encounter any \ *major* problems with the demo,
feel free to `contact us`_ and explain the situation. We'll do our best
to help you out!

Well, I guess I can't stall any more, so **without further ado:**

-  **Mac OS X - `torrent`_ **\ or `**direct download**`_
-  **Windows - `torrent`_ **\ or \ `**direct download**`_
-  **Windows 64-bit - `torrent`_ **\ or `**direct download**`_

Direct downloads are graciously provided by our friends over at
`Myst-Aventure`_, and we are very thankful for it. We recommend
`μTorrent`_ as a suitable client for downloading the files via
BitTorrent. If you need help using it, feel free to contact us at our
`support address`_, or just ask in the comments.

We sincerely hope you enjoy this small demonstration as much as we love
working on the project.
