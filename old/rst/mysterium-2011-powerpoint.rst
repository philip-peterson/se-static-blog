Some of you might already know this, but one of the 59 volters gave a
surprise presentation at the `DutchMystCommunity`_ gathering this
weekend. It was quite a success, and we're working on getting some
footage of the event.

In the meantime, there have been some requests, from both
english-speaking and Dutch communities, for downloadable Powerpoint
slideshows, so you can all relive the magic of being at a Myst gathering
this year. Here they are!

-  `English powerpoint`_
-  `Dutch powerpoint`_

(These should both work whether or not you have PowerPoint installed. If
not, let us know and we'll do our best to fix them up for you)

These are for personal enjoyment only, if you'd like to present either
of these at some kind of a gathering (like Mysterium or
DutchMystCommunity), please let us know first.
