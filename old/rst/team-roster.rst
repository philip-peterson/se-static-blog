Everett, a highly skilled Blender artist, originally caught the
interests of the team with his own 'realRiven' project. After joining
the team, he has contributed a large amount to various environments,
both as a modeler and a texturer, as well as as an effects artist,
having created the concept for the current sky system. He hails from
Memphis and attends the Savannah College of Art Design, and is a great
component of the team, well-deserving of an ice cream cone.

**Matthew Sampson**

   <div>

An animator who sails the high seas of awesomeness, Matt Sampson is a
wizard. He's contributed tons to the most painstaking and
cleverness-requiring aspects of the project, including meticulously
matching terrain and architecture in a 3D view using 2D reference shots,
and creating and texturing 54 unique vegetation assets for the game, all
of which breathe life into the recreated world. Equipped with Full Sail
education, he has also begun the daunting task of rigging and animating
the character models.

Nick, another spectacular 3D artist, is first and foremost the project's
very own, custom-caught Australian. Armed with experience in Maya, Nick
has used his Australianity to fight the various challenges that have
reared their collective ugly head, by demonstrating superb and
detail-oriented modeling skill in the face of darkness. In the future,
he will probably be working with Matt on character animation. Nick has
also played an active part in planning for the project, and always is a
great conversation-haver.

Merijn is our professional critic. A product designer with an emphasis
on engineering, professionally, he always provides some assessment of
how we could do things better, more efficiently, or more clearly.
Additionally, Merijn has begun the large task of recreating the terrain
on Jungle Island in three dimensions, from scratch and without much of a
reliable overhead view, which is an easy task by no means.

A founder of the Starry Expanse project, Zib is our valiant leader and
spokesperson. Though he was somewhat intimidated by the concept of
building a "realRiven" at first, he has triumphed and represents us
every year at Mysterium. He began as the project's sole modeler and
Blender user, but now contributes more with the public- and
programming-related aspects of the project. Zib also serves as the
project treasurer.

Philip is a founder of the Starry Expanse project, along with Zib. He
started out planning and modeling, but has since changed over to
programming. He enjoys SeaWorld and The Lion King, and a pioneer of new
systems, he is always eager to help the project stay equipped with the
greatest in project facilitation, even if it means building a tool from
the ground up.

Will has an amazing talent for low level computer programming stuff...
and art too! He's one of our main modelers and texture artists at the
moment, and he's often surrounded by a torrent of technology.

A professional software developer, Ned has been exceedingly helpful in
the process of making the age of Riven interactive. He has also been
generous enough to offer us many gifts in kind, particularly the use of
his server space. He hangs around the coffee machine with us and answers
our many programming questions.

An experienced programmer, OHB has been extremely helpful in answering

to translate Riven into over 60 languages! Working with him is simply
peachy.
