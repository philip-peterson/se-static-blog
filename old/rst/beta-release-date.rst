Our Beta Signup program will be released this coming Monday, December
[STRIKEOUT:14] 21, at 6:00 PM Eastern Standard Time. Be ready! :)

A few technical details: there will be three applications, one for Mac,
one for Windows, and one for either platform. The former two will be
standalone executables but very large (the Mac one we know is upwards of
28 Mb) so if you're absolutely set on being one of the first to sign up
for Beta, we'd recommend going with the Python one, since it is smaller
and will download more quickly. It will require some version of Python 2
(NOT 3) and each of the following Python modules: wx, wx.richtext,
wx.wizard, os, cStringIO, base64, tempfile, subprocess, platform, re,
urllib2, urllib.

In response to some of the comments, the programs we will distribute on
Monday are only **signup** programs. Beta itself will come later, and we
will invite users to it in chunks in order of signup. The actual Beta
program (to be released later) will be distributed for use with an
existing copy of URU.
