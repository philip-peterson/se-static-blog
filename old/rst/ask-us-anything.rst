You guys know we're always here if you want to talk. Just post in a
comments section, or send us an e-mail, and we'll reply as soon as we
can. Other people, though, people who maybe don't frequent this site,
don't know how accessible we are. In order to remedy this, we've decided
to hold an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session on Reddit, on **Monday, August
20th, at 10AM EDT (14h00 UTC)**.

We hope you can come join the rest of the Internet in asking about our
project!
