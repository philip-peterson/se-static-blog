You may have noticed that our lovely forum is gone. This is because
Convore, the service that we picked for hosting the board, has been shut
down, through decisions that had absolutely nothing to do with us.

We did, however, manage to make a backup of all of the conversations on
the board, so that they can (eventually) be restored to a new (and
better) forum. We're working on making our network of sites fully
integrated with one another, so that one login works here for
commenting, on the forum, in our bug tracker, etc.

In other news, we're ramping up asset production again, so expect more
new images soon!

And no, none of the above is an April Fool's joke. We decided that it
would be too cruel after posting so little for months.
