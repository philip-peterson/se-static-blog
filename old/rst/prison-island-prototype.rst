Here's a treat, while we get the high-quality presentation video edited
up - a pre-rendered lighting test for Prison Island. These are the same
assets you saw in the `Mysterium presentation`_, but in a pre-rendered
environment. This video is **NOT** gameplay footage. It was rendered in
Blender, in order to demonstrate how the environment should look at
sunset. Enjoy!
