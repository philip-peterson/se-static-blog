If you saw `the presentation at Mysterium`_, you might have been
disappointed to hear that beta signup was closed. Good news: it's not!
:-) Bad news: the server is down, so until it's back up, you can send
your name and email to `cho102997@gmail.com`_ with the subject "Beta"
and we'll notify you as soon as signup is back online (we'll post here
as well)!

UPDATE: We're actually going to kill the beta signup client; it's
creating more problems than it solves. Expect an online signup form soon
:-)
