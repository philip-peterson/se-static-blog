Ok, ok, ok. You asked for it, we promised it, here it finally is.
In-game footage from Prison Island, circa Mysterium 2011. This is a good
example of what the game looks like at the moment, though not at all a
good example of the final level of quality we're aiming for.

Unfortunately, due to a quirk in our video-capture solution, the
recording came out a little jerky. This is especially noticeable in the
cursor. We'll try to fix this in future videos, but for now, just
remember that the actual game plays nice and smoothly.

Be sure to see the video in HD!

More to come soon!

Edit: We appreciate the comments and critiques, everybody, but please
keep in mind that this is a work in progress. We're constantly working
on making the game look even better than it does here, in fact it's
mainly what we're focused on right now. We're taking your comments into
consideration, along with our own plans for improvement.

Edit 2: **We've re-rendered this video so it's smoother, and it includes
sound and more! `Check it out!`_**
