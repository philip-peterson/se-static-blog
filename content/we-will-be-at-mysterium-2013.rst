It's been quiet around here for the past months, and there's a reason
for that: We have been busy getting ready for **Mysterium 2013**!

Every year at Mysterium, the Myst fan convention, we present some of our
latest work. The past two years, we have presented Prison Island, but
this year we will be doing something a little different. Mysterium will
be held in Rochester, New York, from August 2nd through the 4th. If you
want to see the presentation in person, all you have to do
isÂ \ `register`_, and show up in Rochester! If you can't make it in
person, you can also watch online - Mysterium traditionally has offered
a live stream of panels and events, and we expect this year to be the
same. We'll provide more details as soon as we receive them.

See you in August!
